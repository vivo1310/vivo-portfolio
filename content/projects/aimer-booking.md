## Description

- My friend is running her small business, a little, beautiful homestay located in Dalat, Vietnam. She was frustrated with manually writing booking confirmation note to send to her guess. So I offered to help her out by creating this simple app.
- This is a mobile responsive web app where users just need to fill in the form and a booking confirmation note will be generated for them to copy and paste.

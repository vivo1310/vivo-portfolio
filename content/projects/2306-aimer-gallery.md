## Description

- This project is made with love for my dear friends who are running their small homestay/airbnb business located in Dalat, Vietnam.
- Most guests prefer to book directly with the owner via social media messaging. So, whenever a guest asks for available room options for a specific date, she'll need find photos and send to the guest to view.
- She's still building contents on the social media fanpage/channel and I think I could help her out. Building a website where customers could learn more about room options and other amenities that the homestay offers.
- The images are compressed and hosted on Google Firebase Storage and the app is built using React JS and Material UI.

### Tech stack

- React created with Vite - to create components, routing, and so on
- Firebase Storage - to host images for the gallery
- Material UI - to use the ready-made ImageList component with mansory style
